GeoLog is a new kind of location tracker which changes tracking characteristics based on where you are and what you are doing.

On foot, you travel slower than by car, and you may not want to gather location data as often. If you're standing still, why track location at all - it's just a waste of power. If you're on a photo walk, you might only want to track location while walking, and not when doing anything else - like driving to the where the walk starts. When on a long trip, you may wish to use a less accurate low power tracking solution, while on a short trip you may prefer tracking as precisely as possible. This is all profile-based and highly configurable. Based on Google's "fused location provider".

This is a low priority side project for me. It'll see updates when I need them, or when you submit useful improvements

I've used Eclipse+ADT for this project. Project requires you set up the Google Play Service library as well (not included)
